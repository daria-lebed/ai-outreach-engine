## Context
Leads from ICP list (CSV). Goal: fast, human-like personalization at scale.

## Sample Email (AI)
Subject: Quick idea for {Company}
Hi {FirstName}, noticed {HookNote}. I build AI-powered outbound systems that lift reply rates without spam tactics. Worth a quick look?

## Sample LinkedIn DM (AI)

## Before → After
Before: manual writing, inconsistent tone, low reply.
After: standardized, contextual messages; faster throughput.

## Metrics To Track (next iteration)
• Reply rate • Positive interest rate • Time saved (per 50 leads) • Bounce/Spam • Lead quality tags

## Roadmap
Enrichment → Research snippets → HubSpot sync → Follow-ups → Scoring.
