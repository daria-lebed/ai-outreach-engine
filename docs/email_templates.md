### Template C — LinkedIn DM (short)
Hi {first_name} — quick one.
Saw {hook_note}. Are you currently doing outbound with personalization, or is it mostly volume-based?

### Template D — Follow-up (gentle)
{first_name}, just checking in in case this slipped past you.
If now’s not the right time or not relevant — just let me know with a quick no.

### How personalization works
Each template supports light personalization:
- {hook_note} = context line (company growth, hiring, product launch, etc)
- {one-liner} = credibility or relevance sentence
- {CTA} = soft or direct call to action
