# Email Templates

### Template A — Direct
Subject: Quick one, {first_name}

Hi {first_name}, saw {hook_note}.  
We help teams improve outbound replies by fixing follow-ups and message structure.  
Worth a quick chat?

### Template B — Warmer
Subject: {company} outreach

Hi {first_name}, noticed {hook_note}.  
I build simple outreach systems that generate replies without spam tactics.  
Happy to share 2–3 ideas if useful.

### Template C — LinkedIn DM (short)
Hi {first_name} — quick one.
Saw {hook_note}. Are you currently doing outbound with personalization, or is it mostly volume-based?

### Template D — Follow-up (gentle)
{first_name}, just checking in in case this slipped past you.
If now’s not the right time or not relevant — just let me know with a quick no.

### How personalization works
Each template supports light personalization:
- {hook_note} = context line (company growth, hiring, product launch, etc)
- {one-liner} = credibility or relevance sentence
- {CTA} = soft or direct call to action
